# Theater-Seat-Booking-app
  I developed a dynamic and user-friendly movie seating booking application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This application enables users to effortlessly select and book seats for movies, with a real-time display of seat availability and pricing. The user interface is designed to be intuitive, ensuring a smooth booking experience for users of all technical backgrounds.

# Features
  1. Interactive Seating Layout: The application features a visually appealing seating chart that differentiates between available, selected, and occupied seats. Users can click on the          seats to select or deselect them, providing a clear visual representation of their choices.
  2. Movie Selection: A dropdown menu allows users to choose from a list of movies. Upon selection, the seating layout and pricing dynamically update to reflect the chosen movie, ensuring       accurate information is always displayed.
  3. Real-Time Price Calculation: As users select seats, the total price is automatically calculated and displayed. This feature ensures transparency and helps users make informed decisions based on their budget.
  4. Booking Confirmation: Once the user finalizes their seat selection, the application provides a booking confirmation. This includes updating the seat status to occupied, ensuring that       other users cannot select the same seats, and displaying a confirmation message to the user.
  5. Responsive Design: The application is designed to be fully responsive, making it accessible and functional across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones. This        ensures a consistent and enjoyable user experience regardless of the device used.

# Technologies Used:

  1. HTML: Used to structure the layout and elements of the application, ensuring a semantic and accessible design.
  2. CSS: Applied to style the application, creating a visually appealing interface that enhances the user experience. CSS was also used to implement responsive design techniques, ensuring      the application looks great on all screen sizes.
  3. JavaScript: Utilized to add interactive features and dynamic functionalities. JavaScript handles events such as seat selection, movie changes, and real-time price calculations,             making the application responsive to user actions.
