# Features
  1. Interactive Seating Layout: The application features a visually appealing seating chart that differentiates between available, selected, and occupied seats. Users can click on the          seats to select or deselect them, providing a clear visual representation of their choices.
  2. Movie Selection: A dropdown menu allows users to choose from a list of movies. Upon selection, the seating layout and pricing dynamically update to reflect the chosen movie, ensuring       accurate information is always displayed.
  3. Real-Time Price Calculation: As users select seats, the total price is automatically calculated and displayed. This feature ensures transparency and helps users make informed decisions based on their budget.
  4. Booking Confirmation: Once the user finalizes their seat selection, the application provides a booking confirmation. This includes updating the seat status to occupied, ensuring that       other users cannot select the same seats, and displaying a confirmation message to the user.
  5. Responsive Design: The application is designed to be fully responsive, making it accessible and functional across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones. This        ensures a consistent and enjoyable user experience regardless of the device used.
